# Automated Pet Feeder System

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project simulates the logic and behavior of an **automated pet feeder system** designed for a local animal shelter. The system is intended to dispense food at scheduled times, monitor food consumption, and alert staff in case of issues. It is built using low-cost components and follows a structured problem-solving process.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Dispenses food at scheduled times (08:00 and 18:00)
- Monitors food level in the container
- Measures bowl weight before and after dispensing
- Sends alerts for:
  - Low food level (Alert1)
  - Failed dispensing (Alert2)
  - Pet not eating (Alert3)
- Looping logic to repeat the process while the system is ON
